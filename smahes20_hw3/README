Homework 2 CS 342
project part 2: Development of Question, answer and exam classes. these classes
    also use multiple inherited classes to run the program.

*************************************************************************
Description: 

The main feature to be added in the next release is the ability to save and restore Exams and Exam
components, as a precursor to creating functional programs for the creation, taking, and grading of
Exams. Only one new class will be added, but a few new methods and fields will be added to existing
classes, and some are also removed. The new class will be a ScannerFactory, which will allocate a
singleton Scanner for reading from the keyboard, and will provide access to the one and only keyboard
Scanner as needed. Note that the exam answers will be kept in a separate file from the questions, so
that each student can have their own answer file.

**************************************************************************
How to run the program:

The program can be run by using the makefile which uses ExamTester.java
and its dependencies Answer.java, Question.java Exam.java classes.these classes also have 
multiple dependencies that are called using inheritance. it also creates 
various other java object classes namely: Answer.class, Question.class, Exam.class
and ExamTester.class .
Given below is the general command to run the program:
        
                "make exam"
    (this command compiles all the .java files in the the folder namely Answer.java, 
    Question.java, Exam.java, ExamTester.java)

                "java ExamTester"
    (this command runs the program i.e. displays the questions and their answer,
    points earned in each question and total points earned in the exam.)

**************************************************************************
Other details about the program:

The Exam contains 3 questions that are worth 1 point each. If the user get a question wrong 0 
points are awarded,and there is no negative marking for the question. So if the user gets one of 
the questions wrong, the user will get 2.0/3.0 points. All the methods in the
classes are public except the constructor in the answer class and all the variable declarations are 
kept protected so that the children classes can access these variables. 
There are a few libraries that are used in the program like the Random library 
which is used to randomise the questions and their answers.The arraylist library 
is also used to use Lists like answers in MCQuestion.java and questions in 
Exam.java. The Answer.java, Question.java, MCQuestion.java, MCAnswer.java are 
abstract classes and just have methods declared in it that is the inisialization is done
in their children classes that are inheriting these classes.

Technical issues:
for get value in MCMA question, for some reason the credit if selected is not being read
and maybe is initialized to 0. which as a result does not sum up the value obtained by
the question properly.
